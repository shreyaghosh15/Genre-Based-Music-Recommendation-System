# Genre-Based Music Recommendation System
I have used a Machine Learning item-based collaborative filtering approach to recommend songs to a user, based on a crowdsourced data of listen counts of 1 million songs. <br/>
Citation: The songs metadata is from The Million Song Dataset by Thierry Bertin-Mahieux, Daniel P.W. Ellis, Brian Whitman, and Paul Lamere. I have created a subset of this dataframe containing 400,000 songs to train our model. <br/>
