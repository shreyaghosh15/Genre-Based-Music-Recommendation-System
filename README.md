# Genre-Based Music Recommendation System
I have used a Machine Learning item-based collaborative filtering approach to recommend songs to a user, based on other users' listen-counts of the other songs in the same music dataset.
Citation: The songs metadata is from The Million Song Dataset by Thierry Bertin-Mahieux, Daniel P.W. Ellis, Brian Whitman, and Paul Lamere. We have created a subset of this dataframe containing 400,000 songs to train our model.
